## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Import Workflows

1. Download all workflow JSON files from the `/workflows` folder
2. In n8n, go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
3. Import each file in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
4. After importing, you'll see warning icons on nodes that need credentials

### Step 2: Set Up Credentials

In n8n, go to **Credentials** and create:

| Credential Type | Name Suggestion    | Used In        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Header Auth     | OpenRouter API     | Workflows 2, 3 |
| Header Auth     | ScrapeCreators API | Workflow 1     |
| OAuth2          | Google Sheets      | All workflows  |
| OAuth2          | Google Drive       | Workflow 3     |
| OAuth2          | Slack (optional)   | Workflow 4     |

See [API Keys Required](#-api-keys-required) for details on each.

### Step 3: Configure Google Sheets

1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Copy the Document ID from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[THIS-IS-THE-DOCUMENT-ID]/edit
   ```
3. Update this ID in all Google Sheets nodes across all workflows

### Step 4: Update Competitor Target

In Workflow 1, find the "Config Settings" node and update:

```javascript
const config = {
  competitor_page_id: "YOUR_COMPETITOR_PAGE_ID", // Facebook Page ID
  competitor_name: "Competitor Name",
  // ... other settings
};
```

**How to find a Facebook Page ID:**

1. Go to the competitor's Facebook page
2. View page source or use a tool like [Find My FB ID](https://findmyfbid.com/)

### Step 5: Update Brand Guidelines

In your Google Sheet's `Brand_Guidelines` tab, update the values to match your brand:

| Field           | Value                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| brand_name      | Your Brand Name                   |
| tagline         | Your tagline                      |
| primary_color   | #EC4899                           |
| secondary_color | #1F2937                           |
| accent_color    | #10B981                           |
| voice           | Direct, tactical, proof-driven    |

2. Open Workflow 1
3. Click "Execute Workflow" to run manually
4. Monitor the execution and check each workflow triggers correctly
5. Verify data appears in your Google Sheet

## 🎨 Customization

### Change the Competitor

Update the `page_id` in Workflow 1's Config Settings node:

```javascript
const config = {
  competitor_page_id: "NEW_PAGE_ID",
  competitor_name: "New Competitor Name",
};
```

### Add Multiple Competitors

Modify Workflow 1 to loop through multiple page IDs:

```javascript
const competitors = [
  { page_id: "123456789", name: "Competitor A" },
  { page_id: "987654321", name: "Competitor B" },
];
```

### Customize Brand Voice

Update your `Brand_Guidelines` tab with:

- Your brand colors (hex codes)
- Your voice/tone description
- Words to avoid
- Target audience description

### Change Image Aspect Ratio

The system automatically detects the competitor's aspect ratio. To override:

In Workflow 3's "Build Image Request" node, change:

```javascript
let aspectRatio = "1:1"; // Force square
// Options: "1:1", "4:5", "9:16", "16:9"
```

### Adjust Effectiveness Scoring

In Workflow 1, modify the effectiveness formula:

```javascript
const score = runDurationDays * 0.7 + collationCount * 10 * 0.3;
```

Increase `runDurationDays` weight if you value longevity more.
Increase `collationCount` weight if you value active testing more.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Node 'X' hasn't been executed"

This usually means you're referencing a node that isn't in the current execution path. Use:

```javascript
$("When Executed by Another Workflow").first().json;
```

Instead of:

```javascript
items[0].json;
```

### Images not generating correctly

1. Check the NanaBanana output - images are in `choices[0].message.images[0].image_url.url`
2. Ensure you're extracting base64 from the data URL: `dataUrl.split(',')[1]`
3. Verify the base64 starts with `/9j/` (JPEG) or `iVBORw` (PNG)

### Google Sheets not updating

1. Verify the Document ID is correct
2. Check that the tab names match exactly (`Competitor_Ads`, `Brand_Guidelines`)
3. Ensure the OAuth credential has write permissions
4. Check that "Always Output Data" is enabled on Google Sheets nodes

### Workflow not triggering next workflow

1. Ensure all workflows are **Active** (toggle in top-right)
2. Check that Execute Sub-Workflow nodes have the correct workflow selected
3. Verify the target workflow has a "When Executed by Another Workflow" trigger

### Vision analysis returning empty

1. Check that the image URL is accessible
2. Verify the image was downloaded successfully (check binary data)
3. Ensure OpenRouter API has sufficient credits

### Rate limits or timeouts

1. Add Wait nodes between API calls if hitting rate limits
2. For image generation (30-60 seconds), ensure your n8n timeout is sufficient
3. Consider adding retry logic for failed requests
